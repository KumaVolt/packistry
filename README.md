### Features

- **Private Repository Support**: Keep your sensitive or proprietary packages secure by hosting them in private repositories.

- **Package Source Integration**: Easily manage and import Composer packages from various platforms:
    - **GitHub**
    - **GitLab**
    - **Gitea**

  Stays up to date automatically, as Packistry uses **webhooks** to pull the latest changes from your source repositories.

- **Comprehensive Repository Management**:
    - **Public/Private Repository Options**: Define repositories as public or private based on your project needs.
    - **Human Access Control**: Create user accounts to assign and manage access to your private repositories, ensuring only authorized individuals can interact with sensitive content.
    - **Machine Access Control**: Generate deploy tokens to allow machines (e.g., build systems or CI/CD pipelines) to access private repositories, ensuring smooth, secure automation.

Packistry combines ease of use, flexibility, and security to give you complete control over your PHP package distribution in a self-hosted environment. Whether you're managing a private project, a team of developers, or an open-source initiative, Packistry streamlines your workflow with minimal configuration and maximum control.
